	description = In 1903 Czarist Russia, an obscure schoolteacher named Konstantin Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky, living in the equally obscure town of Borovsk, Kaluga Province published "Exploration of Space with Reactive Devices" in the Russian journal "Scientific Review". In summary, Tsiolkovsky laid out in mathematical terms that: <b><color=yellow>1: </color></b>Space flight is possible     <b><color=yellow>2: </color></b>This can be accomplished only by means of rocket propulsion     <b><color=yellow>3: </color></b>Gunpowder rockets cannot be used due to lack of energy     <b><color=yellow>4: </color></b>Certain liquids do possess that energy     <b><color=5: >c: </color></b>Liquid hydrogen would be a good fuel, and liquid oxygen a good oxidizer. Used together they would be a nearly ideal propellant. Unfortuantely, no one noticed (yet).

	description = The first true rockets were used in the Battle of Kai-Keng, 1232, when the Chinese used 'arrows of flying fire' to repel the invading Mongols. Rockets were for war, and spaceflight was not only fanciful, but impractical as well, with little use. Nevertheless, spaceflight became an actual engineering possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard's publication in 1919 of his paper "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes", where his application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid fuel rockets gave sufficient power for interplanetary travel to become possible. This paper was highly influential on Hermann Oberth and Wernher Von Braun, later key players in spaceflight.

	description = In the early days of modern rocketry, 'space' was still an esoteric, not quite legitimate concept even in many scientific and military circles. Slowly the idea of a satellite became a 'have-to-have' for military minds, but research remained focused on high speed suborbital flight, both manned and unmanned. 'Space' became legitimate when in 1957 the Soviet Union shocked the intelligence, military, and scientific communities with the launch of Sputnik-1.

	description = Waffenamt (WaA) was the German Army Weapons Office, and served both Germany and the Third Reich. WaA was responsible for the research and development of weapons, ammunition, and army equipment for the German Reichswehr, and later the Wehrmacht. It was founded on November 8, 1919 as Reichwaffenamt (RWA), and the name was changed on May 5, 1922 to Heereswaffenamt (HWA).

	description = After German V-2 parts and technology were imported into the United States, the U. S. Army formed the Upper Atmosphere Research Panel in early 1946 as part of the Hermes Project. The panel was tasked with overseeing experiments with the V-2 regarding both the technology within and their use for upper atmosphere research. One-third of the panel members were General Electric scientists. General Electric employees, with the help of German specialists, assembled V-2's at White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico, where the Army constructed a blockhouse and Launch Complex 33, now a National Historical Landmark.

	description = The Korolev Bureau, led by Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, originated in 1946 as Section 3 of the SKB (Special Design Bureau) of NII-88 (Scientific Research Institute). Korolev was tasked with copying the German V-2 and further development of ballistic missiles. As the work grew, Korolev's organization became reorganized at higher levels. In 1950 Section 3 became OKB-1 (Research Design Bureau) of NII-88. In 1953 Korolev was given the responsibility of developing the world's first ICBM. On August 14, 1956 OKB-1 become an independent design bureau. On the basis of the R-7 Korolev was able to achieve a series of space "first's" from 1957-1965 that kept the Soviet Union in the lead of the space race. In 1964 Korolev plunged into the task of building the N1 superbooster and beating the Americans to the moon.
