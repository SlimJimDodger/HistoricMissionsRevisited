   description = The first living creature to enter orbit was a female mongrel originally named Kudryavka (Little Curly) but later renamed Laika (Barker). Laika was delivered into space by Sputnik-2, which launched at approximately 5:30 PM Moscow time, November 3, 1957. Laika survived the launch and her heart rate returned to normal after a time. Although she had proven that an animal could survive sustained spaceflight, in practice the environmental control system was not up to the task, and telemetry showed that temperature and humidity increased relentlessly. By the fourth orbit none of the physiological sensors were returning data, Laika had died. This fact was not revealed until the 21st Century.

	synopsis = Due to the huge success of Sputnik-1, Nikita Khrushchev ordered Sergey Korolev back to work creating a Sputnik-2, and demanded it be ready for the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. The Sputnik-2 payload was approximately 10 times the mass of Sputnik-1, including a separate capsule for the dog Laika.

	
	completedMessage = Sputnik-2 detected the Earth's outer radiation belt in the far northern latitudes, but researchers did not immediately realize the significance of the elevated radiation because Sputnik 2 passed through the Van Allen belt too far out of range of the Soviet tracking stations.  In Australia, Professor Harry Messel intercepted the signals. Other stations in Australia and South America had also been in range and intercepted the signals. However, the Soviets would not release the code that would allow the stations in Australia and South America to read the signals, and without the code, the stations would not cooperate and send the data to the Soviets. 

	notes = In the U.S.S.R., six days after the launch of Sputnik-2 and on the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, Nikita Khrushchev boasted in a speech 'Now our first Sputnik is not lonely in its space travels.'
