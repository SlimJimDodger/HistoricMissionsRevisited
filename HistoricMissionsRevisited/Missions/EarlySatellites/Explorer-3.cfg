	description = Explorer-3 (international designation 1958 Gamma) was an artificial satellite of the Earth. The objective of this spacecraft was a continuation of experiments started with Explorer-1. The payload consisted of a cosmic ray counter (a Geiger-Mueller tube), and a micrometeorite detector (erotion gauge). The Explorer-3 spacecraft was spin stabilized and had an onboard tape recorder to provide a complete radiation history for each orbit. It was discovered soon after launch that the satellite was in a tumbling motion with a period of about 7s. Explorer-3 decayed from orbit on June 27, 1958, after 93 days of operation.
