    description = In 1948, Mikhail Klavdiyevich Tikhonravov made an unsuccessful proposal to the Kremlin to develop artificial satellites, showing it would be possible to 'package' several existing rockets into a single vehicle, thus reaching the velocity needed to orbit a satellite of a considerable mass. One critic characterized a pack of rockets as a 'wooden plank flying against the airflow'. Undeterred, he carried on with his work, and in October 1951 Tikhonravov suggested a flight to the Moon with two men in a 1,000-ton spacecraft. However, the disinterest of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in peaceful space pursuits doomed these suggestions. Finally, on May 27, 1954, a year after Stalin's death, Mikhail Tikhonravov was authorized to develop and launch satellite systems. On August 30, 1955, a unit was formed within Tikhonravov's section of OKB-1 (Korolev's secret design bureau) to develop the first satellite, a device named the 'Zenit'. But development of this satellite, code-named 'Object D' progressed more slowly than expected, and was not ready in time for the International Geophysical Year celebration. The decision was made to precede the launch of Object D with a 'prosteishy sputnik', or 'simplest satellite'. Zenit would have to wait. 
	 
	synopsis =  Sputnik-1 was the first artificial satellite of Earth, and transmitted signals for 21 days. Launched with an apoapsis of 945 km (587 mi), periapsis of 227 km (141 mi), and an inclination of 65 degrees, it remained in orbit until January 4, 1958. 
	notes = Tracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided all scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.
