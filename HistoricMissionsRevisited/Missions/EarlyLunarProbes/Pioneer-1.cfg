	description = On October, 11 1958, just ten days after NASA's foundation, Pioneer-1 was launched. The second stage was shut down too early, leaving Pioneer 1 with a lack of speed to fulfill its mission. It was hoped that firing the Falcon motor would put the probe into an Earth orbit, but the ignition failed due to low temperatures of the batteries. Pioneer-1 flew up to a height of 113854 km, less than a third of the distance of the Moon and fell back, disintegrating in the atmosphere after a 43 hours, 17 seconds flight.
