	description = Luna 1, also known as Mechta (Russian: lit.: Dream), E-1 No.4 and First Cosmic Ship, was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity of the Earth's Moon, and the first spacecraft to be placed in heliocentric orbit. Intended as an impactor, Luna 1 was launched as part of the Luna programme on January 2, 1959. Due to an incorrectly timed upper stage burn during its launch, it missed the Moon and became the first spacecraft to achieve Earth escape velocity. 

	synopsis = Luna 1 passed within 5,995 km of the Moon's surface on 4 January after 34 hours of flight. It went into orbit around the Sun, between the orbits of Earth and Mars. 
	notes = The measurements obtained during this mission provided new data on the Earth's radiation belt and outer space, including the discovery that the Moon had no magnetic field and that a solar wind, a strong flow of ionized plasma emmanating from the Sun, streamed through interplanetary space.
