	description = The Aggregat 3 (A-3) was the third in a series of ballistic missiles designed and developed by Wernher von Braun in 1937 under the leadership of Dr. Walter Robert Dornberger, at Kummersdorf, south of Berlin. The first of the Aggregat rockets to be launched from the Peenem√ºnde area, the initial A-3 was sent off on December 4, 1937 as part of Operation Lighthouse. The first and second launches displayed problems with both premature parachute deployment and engine failure, and both crashed close to their takeoff points. The parachute was disabled in the third and fourth rockets, but these too experienced engine failures, though the lack of parachute drag allowed them to crash further from the launch site. <b><color=white>   First Launch Date: December 4, 1937 </color></b>
