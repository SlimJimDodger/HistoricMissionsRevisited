    description = On August 8, 1957 the first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) was launched, the R-7 8K71 (8000 km model 71). Although the initial 8K71 was never put into military service (superseded by the R-7A) an 8K71 was modified as the 8K71PS (PS standing for 'prosteishy sputnik', or 'simplest satellite'). The R-7 and it's modern variants have proved to be the safest, most reliable, and heavily utilized rocket to date. Nearly 70 years after it's first successful flight, it's modern variant is the only (as of 2019) rocket certified to carry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).  
	 
	synopsis = The Korolev Cross is a visual phenomenon observed in the smoke plumes of the R-7 series rockets during separation of the four liquid-fueled booster rockets attached to the core stage. As the boosters fall away from the rocket, they pitch over symmetrically due to aerodynamic forces acting upon them, forming a cross-like shape behind the rocket.
	notes = A variant of the R-7 launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, into orbit and became the basis for the R-7 family which includes Sputnik, Luna, Molniya, Vostok, and Voskhod space launchers, as well as the latest Soyuz variants. Launch the first R-7.
