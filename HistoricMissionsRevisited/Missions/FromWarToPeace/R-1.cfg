	description = Joseph Stalin did not decide to proceed with Soviet production of this copy of the German V-2 until 1948. Despite the threatening supervision of Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin's secret police chief, and the assistance of German rocket engineers, it took eight years for the German technology to be absorbed and the missile to be put into service. It was almost immediately superseded by later designs, but the effort laid the groundwork for the Soviet rocket industry. Surplus R-1's were converted to use as sounding rockets for military and scientific research missions. <b><color=white>   First Launch Date: September 17, 1948 </color></b> 
	
	synopsis = To accomplish putting the R-1 into production the resources of 13 research institutes and 35 factories were tapped.
