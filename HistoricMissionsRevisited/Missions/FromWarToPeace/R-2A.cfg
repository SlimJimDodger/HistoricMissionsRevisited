    description = The Soviet R-2 ballistic missile was developed in 1947-1953, nearly in parallel with the R-1 from which it derived. Some equipment tested on the R-2 found its way onto canine flights of Sputnik and Vostok. The R-2A was the main R-2 variant for scientific work, used to continue the experiment series of the R-1 to a height of 200 kilometers. Instruments were carried to study the atmosphere over 150 km, ultra-violet solar observation, ultra-violet astronomy, the ionosphere; and the recovery of biological payloads (dogs and rabbits) from double the altitude of the R-1.<b><color=white>   First Experimental Launch Date: September 21, 1949</color></b>
