	description = The R-1V version of the Soviet R-1 was designed for scientific research at altitudes of up to 100 km, including study of cosmic rays, properties of the atmosphere, solar spectra; effects of zero-G and radiation on animals, and development of recovery of the entire missile using parachutes in order to reuse it for further experimental launches.   <b><color=white>Launch Date: July 22, 1951 </color></b>
	
	synopsis = Although the R-1V only made two official flights, it was important in developing the safe recovery of occupants and experiments
	notes = Prove that you can consistently conduct experiments and return them safely to our homeworld.
